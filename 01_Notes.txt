< Installation of C Compiler >
I don't give a fuck about Windows and Mac. I love Linux and it's my main host machine.
$ sudo dnf groupinstall "Development Tools" -y
$ sudo dnf install gcc -y

`Why am I learning C Language ?` # invented in 1972 by Dennis Ritchie at AT&T Bell Labs, USA
* Primary reason to learn C for me is to start understanding code behind Linux kernel.
* I have just completed a 100 videos playlist on Operating Systems and 
* some of the concepts of it can be well understood with help of C. Even he was using C's code to give certain examples.
* I want to explore more about how operating systems work and C is a great language to understand that.

< What is Programming ? >
- Programming is the process of designing and building executable computer software to accomplish a specific task.
- It involves writing code in a programming language, which is a formal set of instructions that can be understood by a computer.
- Programming enables us to create software applications, automate tasks, and solve complex problems using algorithms and data structures.
< Uses of C Programming Language >
- Major parts of Windows, Linux, and other operating systems are written in C.
- C is widely used in embedded systems and IoT devices.
- C is often used for system programming, including writing operating systems and device drivers.
- C is used in high-performance applications, such as game development and real-time systems.

Actually programs that have to run in limited memory and resources, will benefit from C's efficiency and control over system resources.
==========
* Example C program

```
# include <stdio.h>
int main() {
    printf("Hello, World!\n");
    return 0;
}
    ```

< Chapter 1 : Variables, Constants & Keywords >
# Variables
- Variables are used to store data or values in computer memory.
- In C, a variable must be declared before it can be used.
- The declaration includes the variable's name and type.
- C supports several data types, including int, float, char, and more.

```

int a = 3;          
float b = 4.7;
char c = 'A';

```
< Rules For Naming Variables In C>
1. First character must be a letter (a-z, A-Z) or an underscore (_).
2. No commas and blanks are allowed in variable names.
3. Variable names are case-sensitive (e.g., myVar and myvar are different).
4. No special symbol other than underscore (_) is allowed in variable names.
5. Avoid using keywords or reserved words as variable names. 

+ To increase readability, use meaningful names that describe the variable's purpose. +

# Constants
- Constants are fixed values that do not change during the execution of a program.
